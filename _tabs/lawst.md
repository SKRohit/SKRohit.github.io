**From legal chaos to clarity: Research smarter, not harder.**

### Problem

Legal research is the cornerstone of every lawyer's work. It helps them build strong legal arguments, understand precedents, identify risk and opportunities and make better decisions. Yet it's plagued with inefficiencies. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Every year around 50 million law suits are filed in India, with roughly 26 million receiving formal approval from the court for initiation. [ðŸ”—](https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/njdgnew/index.php)

</aside>

This results in billions of notes, citations, drafts, made by lawyers while preparing for their cases.  Amidst a sea of open tabs and piles of paperwork, lawyers grapple with the challenge of maintaining organisation. Furthermore, they spend countless hours sifting through large amounts of irrelevant information, exacerbating the complexity of the research process. 

<aside>
ðŸš¨ This complete process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, leading to missed opportunities, delayed case resolutions, and increased costs.

</aside>

### **Market Need**

During our initial conversations with various practicing civil, criminal, and corporate lawyers, it became evident that there is a clear demand for a tool to perform legal research in an organised manner. 

One corporate lawyer remarked, 

> "A better research tool would undeniably expedite the process of uncovering pertinent legal interpretations, crucial for our cases."
> 

emphasising the inherently interpretive nature of laws and legal arguments. 

Through these dialogues, we discovered that existing tools for accessing past judgments and relevant constitutional laws are restricted in capabilities. Consequently, finding relevant judgments based on the specifics of their case proves challenging. Moreover, lawyers must navigate between multiple browser tabs:

- to access and understand relevant laws
- to access judgements and their summaries,
- to find cited judgments, and
- take notes in separate word processors

leading to a disorganised, error-prone, and time-consuming research process. Furthermore, while some tools in the market offer context-based search functionalities, their static and non-interactive user interfaces limit their effectiveness. 

### **Market Size**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Legal services is around a **trillion** dollar market worldwide and a multi-billion dollar industry in India. With expanding Indian economy, and the startup ecosystem of India, this space is expected to increase at a **CAGR** of more than **7%**. [ðŸ”—](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-legal-services-market)

</aside>

We believe this growth will be driven by a rising demand for automation tools that simplifyÂ tedious tasks. Startups such as [Lawnics](https://lawnics.com/), [Mike Legal](https://mikelegal.com/), and [InHouse](https://www.inhouse.so/) already provide solutions like judgment summaries, case management tools, and contract drafting tools for the legal domain. The entry of foreign law firms and a thriving startup ecosystem will make the legal market in India more competitive and cost-sensitive. Therefore, the efficiency of lawyers and the integrity of their research will be crucial for maintaining an advantage.

### **Proposed Solution**

Hence, we at *LawstIN Legal* aim to revolutionise legal research, analysis and drafting through **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms. We believe in the transformative potential of LLMs, especially their remarkable capacity to understand natural language and extract insights from vast volumes of unstructured text. 

<aside>
ðŸ›  Moreover, we assert that to fully harness the capabilities of this potent technology for conducting research on extensive datasets:
- domain specific LLMs 
- context-based search engines and
- an improved interactive user interface 
is necessary.

</aside>

*LawstIN Legal* will bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly tool that not only streamlines research but also enables lawyers to perform their work with greater accuracy and confidence.

### Product Feature

Our tool will provide a comprehensive suite of features:

- **Intelligent Summaries:** Concise as well as elaborate summaries of judgements
- **Neural Search:**  Discover similar past judgements based on the current case's facts, jurisdiction, and timeframe
- **Law Explanation:** Retrieve and explain the applicable laws as per the search query
- **Case Comparison:** Compare facts of lawyerâ€™s cases with past judgements  using our integrated NLP tools
- **Repetition**: Lawyers canâ€™t leverage their own past cases and research to improve future results.
- **Seamless User Interface:** Sleek user interface where one can:
    - bookmark, read and make notes within relevant judgements
    - query judgementâ€™s content, just by writing questions
    - see short summaries of the cited judgements just by hovering over them
    - manage separate sessions for each case, ensuring clear organisation
    - prepare draft and arguments using a robust text editor
- **In-House Data Integration:** Perform above tasks on in-house proprietary data as well

and much more. 

<aside>
ðŸŽ¯ Our platform will prominently showcase reference cases for generated answers, enhancing user confidence in the generated results and substantially reducing LLM hallucinations.

</aside>

We believe a tool like this can be engineered to become the preferred choice for legal research by lawyers. As our product matures, we plan to introduce additional features including case analysis capabilities, IP research etc.
