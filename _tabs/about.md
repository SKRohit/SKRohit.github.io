Hi there! 👋 I’m **Rohit Kumar Singh**, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a knack for **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **NLP**. Based in **Bangalore, India**, I spend my time building AI systems that (hopefully) make life easier for people and businesses. I enjoy tackling complex problems, fine-tuning large language models, and finding creative ways to turn research into real-world solutions. 

## My Journey 🚀  
With a background in Mining Engineering from NIT Rourkela, I’ve mined my way into the world of machine learning. Along the way, I’ve built and deployed AI solutions at Intel, Carelon, Zycus, and Infosys—building everything from semantic search systems, NLP-powered bots to performing large scale llm training and contributing to open source projects like Transformers, ZenML. Each step has deepened my skills in LLMs, MLOps, and building impactful, real-world AI applications.

## Technical Expertise 🔧  
Here’s a TL;DR of my skill set:  
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, FastAPI
- **Distributed Deep Learning**: DeepSpeed, Ray, vLLM, multi-GPU & multi-node scaling
- **Databases & Search**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB, Elasticsearch, Qdrant
- **Technical Skills**: CV, NLP, LLMs, Semantic Search, MLOPs, Docker, AWS

## When I’m Not Working 🌟  
You’ll find me exploring Bangalore’s startup scene, reading non-fictions, or playing badminton with my friends.

## Let’s Be Friends 🤝  
Always happy to collaborate on exciting AI projects or discuss the latest in tech! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/skrrohit) or shoot me an email at **rohitku.singh8@gmail.com**. Don’t be a stranger—unless you’re a bot, in which case... well played.
