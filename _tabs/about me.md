Hi there! 👋 I’m **Rohit Kumar Singh**, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a knack for **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **NLP**. Based in **Bangalore, India**, I spend my time building AI systems that (hopefully) make life easier for people and businesses. I enjoy tackling complex problems, fine-tuning large language models, and finding creative ways to turn research into real-world solutions. 

## My Journey 🚀  
With a background in Mining Engineering from NIT Rourkela, I’ve mined my way into the world of machine learning, where I’ve worked on several NLP and CV projects involving **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **MLOps**, and **distributed systems**.

## Technical Expertise 🔧  
Here’s a TL;DR of my skill set:  
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain  
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD, MLflow (a.k.a. the “make it work in production” toolkit)  
- **Databases & Search**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB, Elasticsearch  
- **NLP Wizardry**: GPT, BERT, Llama, LoRA, vLLM, BioBERT, and more acronyms than I care to admit

## When I’m Not Working 🌟  
You can find me playing cricket (because what’s more Indian than that?), following AI advancements, or attempting to learn **German** (currently at “Ich bin ein Anfänger” level).

## Let’s Be Friends 🤝  
Always happy to collaborate on exciting AI projects or discuss the latest in tech! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/skrrohit) or shoot me an email at **rohitku.singh8@gmail.com**. Don’t be a stranger—unless you’re a bot, in which case... well played.
